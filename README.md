## 📌 Overview

This repository contains a **data analytics SQL project** built using a structured **Library Management System** dataset. The project focuses on solving **real-world analytical questions** using SQL queries that involve joins, grouping, filtering, and multi-table relationships.

The goal is to demonstrate how SQL can be used to analyze library operations such as book circulation, branch performance, borrower activity, and author-specific insights.

## 📂 Dataset Structure

The project uses seven relational tables:

* **tbl_book** – book information
* **tbl_book_authors** – authors of each book
* **tbl_book_copies** – copies of each book per branch
* **tbl_book_loans** – borrowing transactions
* **tbl_borrower** – borrower details
* **tbl_library_branch** – branch details
* **tbl_publisher** – publisher records

These tables collectively support analytical queries related to availability, trends, and operational insights.

## 🧠 SQL Queries Included

This project includes **7 analytical SQL queries**, solving:

1. Copies of *The Lost Tribe* in the Sharpstown branch
2. Copies of *The Lost Tribe* across all branches
3. Borrowers with **no active loans**
4. Due-date–specific loans from **Sharpstown**
5. **Books loaned count per branch**
6. Borrowers with **more than 5 active checkouts**
7. Stephen King books available in **Central branch**

Each query demonstrates how to perform data analysis using SQL joins, aggregation, subqueries, and filtering.
